What's this?
============

A hugely over-engineered solution to a problem that probably doesn't exist: how to do Secret Santa with a distributed workforce.

How to use
----------

There are some configurables at the top of the script. You definitely need to supply a list of name => email pairs.

Needs the pony gem (and presumes you can send mail from whatever box you're running it on).

Then try

  ./secretsatan.rb -h
